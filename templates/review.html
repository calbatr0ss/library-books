<input type='text' autofocus /><div class="enrichedContentElement"><h3>Booklist Review</h3><p>*Starred Review* It seems Constance Kopp's career as the first woman deputy sheriff in Bergen County, New Jersey, might end on any page of Stewart's fourth entry in this historical mystery series, which features, as always, Kopp's deeds of daring and tenacity in the face of social prejudice. Stewart again portrays the uncomfortable conditions experienced by women in America in the WWI era, including sketches of women detained on morality charges in the Hackensack jail. The particularly compelling main case here about a woman committed to an insane asylum by her husband under false pretenses furthers this theme and forms the heart of the story. The press relentlessly stalks Constance and Sheriff Heath (now running for Congress), casting aspersions to promote Heath's political rivals. As the sheriff says, A man who does nothing but cast out hate and blame couldn't possibly be elected to office. Balancing these weighty topics are a dry-witted tone and amusing vignettes involving Constance's sister, Norma, and her carrier pigeons, and the naive efforts of Constance's daughter, Fleurette, who believes she is Constance's sister, at finding wartime entertainment. Constance herself a tall, plain woman with a man's job continues to drive the series with a no-nonsense personality that evokes a mix of Laurie R. King's Mary Russell and Lawrence H. Levy's Mary Handley. This entry is more suspenseful than its predecessors and boasts a deeper emphasis on character, politics, and social issues. A must for Constance's growing fan base.--Jen Baker Copyright 2018 Booklist</p></div><br/><div class="enrichedContentElement"><h3>Publisher's Weekly Review</h3><p>Deputy Constance Kopp, of Bergen County, N.J., comes under scrutiny during the brutal 1916 election season in bestseller Stewart's fraught fourth Kopp Sisters novel (after 2017's Miss Kopp's Midnight Confessions). While her mentor and boss, Sheriff Robert Heath, runs for Congress, the real-life Constance prepares for a successor less supportive of the "lady deputy." Her extracurricular investigation into the case of Anna Kayser, a seemingly sane woman whose husband and doctor conspired to send her to a mental institution, unexpectedly threatens to affect the election. Stewart draws on newspaper accounts from the era for the vicious rhetoric aimed at Constance, whose audacity at working in a male-dominated profession provides political fodder for her boss's opponents. Although the Kayser story eventually loses steam, Stewart skillfully builds nail-biting suspense around the election results and Constance's subsequent employment prospects. The blend of practicality, forthrightness, and compassion in her first-person narration is sure to satisfy series fans and win new admirers. Author tour.
