[BKL Ap 1 88]</p></div><br/><div class="enrichedContentElement"><h3>Publisher's Weekly Review</h3><p>Hawking's discovery that black holes emit particles caused great excitement among astronomers. In this succinct overview of current theories of the cosmos, the Cambridge University physicist modestly weaves in his own notable contributions while giving due credit to his colleagues. He explains why relativity implies that a ``big bang'' occurred and examines string theory, which posits a universe of 10 or 26 dimensions. His understanding of time's flow leads him to conclude that intelligent beings can only exist during the expansion phase of our increasingly chaotic universe. New research on black holes and subatomic particles holds implications for scientists who, like Hawking, are attempting to devise a unified theory linking Einstein to quantum mechanics. The merit of this book is Hawking's ability to make these ideas graspable by the lay reader. (April) (c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

That the universe is static, as once thought, eventually proved impossible to reconcile with evidence from astronomy, for how could an expanding universe follow unchanging laws of nature? Hawking, along with mathematician Roger Penrose, discovered the answer: relativity theory not only allows, but requires, a big bang. The discussion does not end therethe universe may really be static, the ``big bang'' being local history in only a part of the universebut once again Hawking has proved himself a pioneer.

The result is a beautifully written volume that is not only informative but exciting to read. Starting with early theories of the nature of the universe, Hawking guides readers through the Newtonian era into modern theories, where the bulk of the material is focused. He discusses the attempts to build a unified field theory (which describes the fundamental forces of the universe in terms of a common denominator), indicates the failure of modern theories to incorporate the gravitational force into such a scheme, and indicates his approach to solving this problem. A chapter entitled ``Arrow of Time,'' includes comments on the psychological, thermodynamic, and cosmological arrows and relates these concepts to the fate of the universe. The book contains some information that can be found in previous publications, but none contains Hawking's distinct style and orientation. The book is slightly marred by the lack of a table of contents and a bibliography, but a glossary and an index are included. In addition, the title may be misleading if quoted without the subtitle, since not much of the book deals directly with time. Highly recommended for all college libraries.-H.E.
